          Happy Rose Day <br>
This rose is for you, because just like it, you make my life softer and more beautiful.
You are the first thought in my morning and the last wish in my night. <br>
If this rose could talk, it would say — I’ve never seen anyone as beautiful as you.
Stay by my side… I just want to walk through every day holding your hand. ❤️❤️❤️
